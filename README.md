# odin-recipes

'odin-recipes' is a project that has been completed as a part of The Odin Project. 

By the end of the project, I should have a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. It won't look great, but that's down to the lack of CSS as this is merely set up focus on building my HTML chops!
