    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I think these twice-baked, very crisp biscuits are great for children to make and eat.
    </p>
    <p>
        After that, the adults in true Italian fashion sit down with a glass of chilled Vin Santo, and dip them into it before each bite.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>110g plain flour</li>
        <li>¾ level teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>25g ground almonds</li>
        <li>50g almonds, skins on</li>
        <li>75g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>a few drops almond extract</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl, then add the ground and whole almonds and sugar.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Give it a good mix, then add the egg and the almond extract, and mix it together first with a wooden spoon and then using your hands to bring the mixture together to form a smooth dough. Now place the dough on a lightly floured surface and, using your hands, roll it into a log about 28cm long. Put it on the lined baking sheet and bake it near the centre of the oven for 30 minutes. After that, transfer it to a cooling tray and leave until completely cold.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then reduce the oven temperature to 150°C, gas mark 2.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Now use a serrated knife to cut the biscotti into slightly diagonal slices about 1cm wide. Then place them back on the lined baking tray and bake for another 30 minutes until pale gold and crisp.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer them to the cooling tray and when cold, store in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
