    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These have been a huge success with everyone who has tasted them, and because they’re cooked on top of the stove, children (with supervision) love making them.

        Serve them warm with lots of butter, and later on they’re very good toasted.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>1 level teaspoon mixed spice</li>
        <li>75g caster sugar</li>
        <li>110g spreadable butter</li>
        <li>110g mixed dried fruit</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>a little milk (if needed)</li>
        <li>a little extra butter</li>

    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First sift the dry ingredients together, and rub in the butter until the mixture is coarsely crumbled.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Then add the fruit and mix it in thoroughly. Now beat the egg lightly and add it to the mixture. Mix to a dough and, if it seems a little too dry, add just a spot of milk. Now transfer the dough onto a lightly floured working surface and roll it out with a floured rolling pin to about 5mm thick. Then, using the cutter, cut the dough into rounds by giving it a sharp tap (and avoid twisting it), re-rolling the trimmings until all the dough is used.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Next, lightly grease the pan, using a piece of kitchen paper smeared with butter. Heat the pan over a medium heat and cook the Welsh cakes for about 3 minutes on each side. If they look as if they’re browning too quickly, turn the heat down a bit because it’s important to cook them through – but they should be fairly brown and crisp on the outside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve them warm, with lots of butter and homemade jam or perhaps some Welsh honey.</li>
    </ol>
