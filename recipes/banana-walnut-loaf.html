    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If I had a pound for every... goes the old cliche.  So here it goes again. 

        If only I had a pound for everyone who has praised this cake, rich pickings!  Although it is made here with butter and lard, you could make it with spreadable butter.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>225g plain flour</li>
        <li>2 level teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>40g butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>40g lard at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>110g caster sugar</li>
        <li>4 medium bananas, peeled</li>
        <li>50g walnuts, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>zest of 1 orange</li>
        <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon demerara sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First sift the flour and baking powder into a roomy mixing bowl, lifting the sieve quite high to give the flour a good airing as it goes down, then add the butter, lard, egg and caster sugar.</li>
        <li>Now, using an electric hand whisk, mix to combine all the ingredients for about one minute until you have a sandy texture. Then in a separate bowl mash the bananas to a pulp with a large fork and briefly whisk them into the cake mixture. Now fold in the chopped walnuts and orange and lemon zests.</li>
        <li>Spoon the cake mixture into the prepared tin, level it off on top with the back of the spoon and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Bake on a lower shelf so the top of the tin is aligned with the centre of the oven for approximately 1 hour 10 minutes. Leave the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out onto a wire cooling rack.</li>
        <li>Store in an airtight tin in its liner</li>
    </ol>>
